    <h1>Drake</h1>
    <p>biography of canadian musician</p>
    <p>by Arcadeni Geiene</p>
    <H2>Early life</H2>
    <p>Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986 in Toronto, Ontario. His father,
         Dennis Graham, is African-American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee,
          who worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis.[17][18]
           His mother, Sandra "Sandi" Graham (née Sher), is a Canadian, from an Ashkenazi Jewish family,
            who worked as an English teacher and florist.[19][20][21][22][23] Dennis Graham performed at Club 
            Bluenote in Toronto, where he met Sandra Sher, who was in attendance.</p>
<p>Drake was raised in two Toronto neighbourhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end[31] until grade six,
     playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.[36] He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods,
      Forest Hill, in 2000.[37][38] When asked about the move, Drake replied, 
      "[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half,
       we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor.
        It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford."[39]</p>
        <p>He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts,
             first acting while an active student at the school.[40] 
             He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood.
              Due to the economic status associated with the neighbourhood,
               Drake described the school as "not by any means the easiest school to go to."[31] 
               Drake was often bullied at school for his racial and religious background,[41] 
               and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career,
                Drake dropped out of school.[42] He later graduated in October 2012.</p>
                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>At the age of 15, Drake, eager to begin his career as an actor,
                     was introduced to a high school friend's father, an acting agent.[44] 
                     The agent found Drake a role on the Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation.
                     He appeared in a total of 100 episodes between 2001 and 2008. </p>
                     <p>Being musically inspired by Jay-Z and Clipse, Drake self-released his debut mixtape,
                         Room for Improvement, in 2006. Room for Improvement was released for sale only and sold roughly 6,000 copies,
                         [45] for which Drake received $304.04 in royalties.[52] In 2007, he released his second mixtape Comeback Season.
                          Released from his recently founded October's Very Own label,
                           it spawned the single "Replacement Girl" featuring Trey Songz.
                            The song made Drake become the first unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video on BET.</p>
                            <p>In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape So Far Gone. It was made available for free download through his OVO blog website,
                                 and featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It received over 2,000 downloads
                                  in the first 2 hours of release, finding mainstream commercial success from the singles "Best I Ever Had"
                                   and "Successful", both gaining Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),
                                    with the former also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
                                    <p>Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010,
                                        [73] debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its first week. 
                                        The album became the top selling debut album for any artist in 2010. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in Miami,
                                         Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs.[81] It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010.
                                         [82] Due to the success of the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in 2010.</p>
