    <p>biography of canadian musician</p>
    <p>by Arcadeni Geiene</p>
    <H2>Early life</H2>
    <p>Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986 in Toronto, Ontario. His father,
         Dennis Graham, is African-American and a practicing Catholic from Memphis, Tennessee,
          who worked as a drummer, performing alongside country musician Jerry Lee Lewis.[17][18]
           His mother, Sandra "Sandi" Graham (née Sher), is a Canadian, from an Ashkenazi Jewish family,
            who worked as an English teacher and florist.[19][20][21][22][23] Dennis Graham performed at Club 
            Bluenote in Toronto, where he met Sandra Sher, who was in attendance.</p>
<p>Drake was raised in two Toronto neighbourhoods. He lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end[31] until grade six,
     playing minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.[36] He then moved to one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods,
      Forest Hill, in 2000.[37][38] When asked about the move, Drake replied, 
      "[We had] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half,
       we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor.
        It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford."[39]</p>
        <p>He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he demonstrated an affinity for the arts,
             first acting while an active student at the school.[40] 
             He later attended Vaughan Road Academy in the city's multicultural Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood.
              Due to the economic status associated with the neighbourhood,
               Drake described the school as "not by any means the easiest school to go to."[31] 
               Drake was often bullied at school for his racial and religious background,[41] 
               and upon realizing that his busy class schedule was detrimental to his burgeoning acting career,
                Drake dropped out of school.[42] He later graduated in October 2012.</p>
